## Notes

- Fuzzing is an effective way to find vulnerabilities in code before it is
  merged or released. A [wiki
  page](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Fuzz-Trophies)
  collects the issues fuzzing could identify.

- Bitcoin Core has [over
  160](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/src/test/fuzz) individual
  fuzz targets, but the code coverage of consensus, validation and P2P code
  paths is [still
  low](https://marcofalke.github.io/btc_cov/fuzz.coverage/index.html). For
  example `MemPoolAccept::AcceptSingleTransaction` never gets past `PreChecks`
  and exits early.

- `MemPoolAccept` is used to accept (or reject) transaction from remote peers, the wallet and the RPC interface.

- The existing `process_message` fuzz target can also test messages of type
  `tx`. It works by [initializing a
  blockchain](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/63314b8211d795b2bf0814e244d801e74f50b152/src/test/fuzz/process_message.cpp#L63),
  then it lets the fuzz engine create a message (e.g. `tx`) from a peer [to be
  processed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/63314b8211d795b2bf0814e244d801e74f50b152/src/test/fuzz/process_message.cpp#L95).

- The new `tx_pool` fuzz target aims to fuzz mempool acceptance more efficiently.

- Refer to [the fuzzing
  doc](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md) on how to
  run a fuzz engine on your machine.

## Questions

1.  Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
    NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
    What was your review approach?

2. Why does the existing `process_message_tx` fuzz target perform so poorly
   when it comes to mempool acceptance?

3. Why does the newly added [`tx_pool` fuzz target](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e4e253d73007e0b680d2a473327c6fd66de4d86c/src/test/fuzz/tx_pool.cpp#L203) achieve higher coverage in `MemPoolAccept` than the `process_message_tx` target?

4. Is it expected to see more transactions rejected or accepted to the mempool in the `tx_pool` target? Why? You may collect evidence to support your answer by debugging the `tx_pool` target or by assuming all fields in the `ConsumeTransaction` helper are initialized by values picked to be uniformly random (Real fuzz engines do not pick values uniformly randomly, but this assumption is good enough for now).

5. How does the `tx_pool_standard` fuzz target improve upon the `tx_pool` fuzz target even further?

6. Do you have other ideas for improvement?
